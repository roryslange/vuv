# vuv

## Description
VUV, or very unhelpful video, is a file format I have created to try and teach myself the basics of GOLANG. I do not expect VUV to gain any sort of momentum or be used in any aspect what-so-ever. The main idea behind VUV is that it describes a file format for videos without audio. It uses the difference in each pixel's color from one frame to the next to describe the video. I am not sure if this is how current video formats work or if there is a similar format out there that works this way, just thought it might be cool to teach myself go. This file format is not intended to be used for any application as it may be unstable. Feel free to join me as I learn GO and maybe accidentially invent a new standard for storing video (probably not).

## Breakdown of components in each VUV file
not sure yet, will finalize as development continues

## Tech Stack
GOLANG? maybe other libraries and stuff
